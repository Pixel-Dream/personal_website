I am <b>Haowen Zhou</b>, a first year Ph.D. student in the <a href='https://bioinformatics.ucsd.edu/'>Bioinformatics and Systems Biology (BISB)</a> program at UC San Diego, under the guidance of <a href='https://cardiology.ucsd.edu/research/labs/chi/index.html'>Dr. Neil C. Chi</a>. My research is rooted in developing explicable and scalable computational approaches to advance integrative multi-modal biological data analysis. I am passionate about creating scalable and robust tools to uncover biological insights from high-dimensional multi-omics datasets.

Prior to my doctoral studies, I earned my M.S. in Bioinformatics from Johns Hopkins University, where I worked in <a href='https://www.stephaniehicks.com'>Dr. Stephanie Hicksâ€™ lab</a> on scalable clustering methods (<a href='https://github.com/Pixel-Dream/spatialMNN'>SpatialMNN</a>) for multi-sample SRT data. I completed my B.S. in Bioscience from Shanghai Jiao Tong University through the prestigious <a href='https://en.zhiyuan.sjtu.edu.cn/'>Zhiyuan Honors Program</a>, where I developed a strong foundation in computational biology, genomics, and molecular biology. My undergraduate thesis involved developing advanced computational tools to analyze multi-modality spatial data under the mentorship of <a href='https://www.wangxiaolab.org/'>Dr. Xiao Wang</a> and <a href='https://cbb.sjtu.edu.cn/~jingli/homepage.php'>Dr. Jing Li</a>.
