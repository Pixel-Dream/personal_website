Thrilled to share our new paper spatialMNN on <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btaf403">Bioinformatics</a>!  
<br>
It's a fast, scalable, and accurate method to integrate multiple spatial transcriptomics (SRT) datasets and identify shared spatial domains.
<br>
Many thanks to for the amazing team behind spatialMNN! Thank you to my brilliant co-authors Pratibha Panwar, Boyi, and Caleb. And to our to our mentors, Shila and Stephanie for their incredible guidance and support.
